		<p>Welcome to Silver Dolphin Photography.  My name is Christopher and I'm the photographer behind the images.  Currently I am based in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. I've been interested in photography since I was in high school but have only been doing it seriously for about 3 years now.  I focus mainly on landscape and nature images. </p>
